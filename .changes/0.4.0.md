## 0.4.0 - 2022-08-04
### Added
* New validator logic ensures consistent and expected return types from all implemented FF clients
* Exposed default in userland so users can have expected behavior for disabled/offline mode and more control in general
### Changed
* By default, we now return MockClient instead of harness client and push explicit specification to the user. This lets FF laced projects execute by default without needing an API key or an explicit variable to disable dbt feature flags
