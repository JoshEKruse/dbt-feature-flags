## 0.4.1 - 2022-11-06
### Added
* CI testing across all dbt versions post 1.0 serving as both integration tests and functional tests
* Added apache license to project

## 0.4.0 - 2022-08-04
### Added
* New validator logic ensures consistent and expected return types from all implemented FF clients
* Exposed default in userland so users can have expected behavior for disabled/offline mode and more control in general
### Changed
* By default, we now return MockClient instead of harness client and push explicit specification to the user. This lets FF laced projects execute by default without needing an API key or an explicit variable to disable dbt feature flags

## 0.3.3 - 2022-08-03
### Added
* Added MockFeatureFlagClient which is used when env var DBT_FF_DISABLE is set in environment. This allows users to disable live clients without breaking their projects
* Started using changie for changelog management
